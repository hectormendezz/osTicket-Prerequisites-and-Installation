<p>
First, we open up our Azure subscription and start off by creating our resource group (RG), this works as a file to store all of our resources on Azure. You want to call it "osTicket" since this is the project we are doing, make sure to keep note of the location you set this resource group in because it is important for later.

<p>
Now we will create our virtual machine (VM), this will allow us to use a fabricated computer within your own computer. I named my VM, "VMosTicket", this also requires you to create a username and password. I kept my username simple with "LabUser" and password "Password1". This is being created within the same RG (osTicket) you created before in step 1. Now locate the virtual machine's IP address for the next step.

Once you are on this page, you can see the IP address on the bottom right corner of the picture. Your IP address might look a little different but don't worry, all of them are different. Copy that address and open up Microsoft Remote Desktop, this will allow us to actually use our VM, select create new pc and paste your IP address into the space it gives you. Then Remote Desktop will ask you to login to the VM, this is the same username and password that you created when you made the virtual machine.

<p>
Now you should be looking at a Windows desktop, here you will download Internet Information Services (IIS). This is a Microsoft web server used to exchange static and dynamic web content with internet users. IIS can be used to host, deploy, and manage web applications using technologies such as ASP.NET and PHP.
When you have it download follow these steps in order, go to Start Menu > Windows Feature > Internet Information Services > World Wide Web Services > Application Development Features > CGI. We needed to enable these settings for the downloading of osTicket.

</p>
<p>
This next step we will download a few things, the PHP manager for IIS and the Rewrite Module. Now once you have these you will also download from the Installation Files; PHP 7.3.8, VC_redist.x86.exe, MySQL 5.5.62. Once all that is in order you will download osTicket, then extract the content to the folder c:\inetpub\wwwroot. Rename the folder "Upload" to "osTicket".

</p>
<p>
When you open up osTicket you will see some '"X's" on some some features that you need enabled, so now we will go into IIS manager and open the file "PHP". This is where you enable php_imap.dll, php_intl.dll, php_opcache.dll, this will allow us to use the features we need for osTicket. Now we will return to our computer's files and go to c:\inetpub\wwwroot\osticket\include, here look for the file named "ost-sampleconfig.php". Right click on this file and open up properties, here you will click on the security tab and then click "Advanced" and disable inheritance, after that you will delete all new permissions and give everyone permissions.

</p>
<p>
Now we will go back to the installation files and download HeidiSQL. Now open it and create a new session with "root" and "Password1" just to keep it simple and rememberable. Then connect to the session and create a database called "osTicket". Return to browser with osTicket open, create and fill in all information but remember all of to operate osTicket in the future. Towards the bottom is where you will fill in the HeidiSQL information.
MySQL Database: osTicket>MySQL Username: root>MySQL Password: Password1> Click â€œInstall Now!"
  
Congratulations! You have successfully installed osTicket! You will now be able to control it as administrator and create new users, create and assign tickets.
